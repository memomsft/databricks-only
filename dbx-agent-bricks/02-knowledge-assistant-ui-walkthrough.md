## What is a Knowledge Assistant?

It ensures **citations**, reducing hallucination and increasing trust.

2. Click **Build** → name it `Retail-Knowledge-Assistant`.
3. **Add files** → point to the Markdown docs generated by the data prep script:  
   - `/Volumes/main/demo_llm/agent_docs/knowledge_base/FAQ.md`  
   - `/Volumes/main/demo_llm/agent_docs/knowledge_base/Policies.md`  
   - `/Volumes/main/demo_llm/agent_docs/knowledge_base/Catalog.md`
4. Add instructions:  
   > “Answer concisely. Always cite sources. If unsure, say you don’t know.”  
5. Test prompts:
   - “What is our return policy for defective items?”
   - “Which product categories do we sell?”
   - “Summarize the shipping policy in 3 bullets.”
