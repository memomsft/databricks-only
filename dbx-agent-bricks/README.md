# Databricks Agent Bricks Workshop

This workshop demonstrates **Databricks Agent Bricks**, a new capability to build and run AI-powered assistants directly in Databricks.

We focus on two **core use cases**:
1. **Knowledge Assistant** â€“ RAG-based Q&A grounded on your own documents with citations.  
2. **Information Extraction** â€“ Turn unstructured docs into structured Delta tables.  

ðŸ‘‰ The goal is to provide a **hands-on demo** that is simple, easy to follow, and highlights business value.
