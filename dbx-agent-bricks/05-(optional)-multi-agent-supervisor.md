# 05 - Multi-Agent Supervisor (UI Walkthrough)

> Multi-Agent Supervisor lets you orchestrate multiple agents and tools (e.g., **Genie Spaces**, **Agent Bricks agents**, and external tools) under a single ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù that coordinates tasks and synthesizes results. 

---

## What you‚Äôll build

A **supervisor agent** that can:
- Delegate to a **Knowledge Assistant** for RAG-style answers.
- Delegate to an **Information Extraction** agent to produce structured JSON from documents. 
- Optionally query a **Genie Space** for data exploration (text-to-SQL) and combine results. 

> This pattern is ideal when tasks span multiple specialties (search, extraction, analytics) and need a single entry point.

---

## Prerequisites

- Unity Catalog enabled and basic workspace permissions to create Agent Bricks resources. 
- At least one **Knowledge Assistant** (pointing to a UC Volume or Vector Search) and/or **Information Extraction** agent ready. 
- (Optional) An existing **Genie Space** with access to demo tables for ad-hoc questions.

## Process at a glance

---

## Step-by-step (Wizard)


In this optional section, we bring all pieces together using a **Multi-Agent Supervisor**.  
The supervisor orchestrates multiple agents:

- **Knowledge Assistant** ‚Üí answers questions from Markdown docs.  
- **Information Extraction Agent** ‚Üí extracts structured JSON from receipts/contracts.  
- **Genie (Databricks SQL Agent)** ‚Üí queries structured datasets in Unity Catalog.  

---

## Why Genie?

To make the demo realistic, we connect Genie to structured **retail datasets**.  
This allows us to ask questions like:

- ‚ÄúTop 5 customers by spend in the last 30 days‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúRevenue by product category‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúOrders per customer in March‚Äù  

These insights complement the **Knowledge Assistant** (docs) and **IE Agent** (raw text ‚Üí JSON).  

---

## Step 1 ‚Äî Create Genie Demo Datasets

We‚Äôll generate three Delta tables in Unity Catalog: `customers`, `products`, `orders`.

```python
from pyspark.sql import Row
import random, datetime

catalog = "<your_catalog>"
schema = "your_schema"

# --- Customers ---
customers = [
    Row(customer_id=i, name=f"Customer {i}", country=random.choice(["US", "MX", "CA", "UK"]))
    for i in range(1, 11)
]
spark.createDataFrame(customers).write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable(f"{catalog}.{schema}.customers")

# --- Products ---
products = [
    Row(product_id=i, category=random.choice(["Electronics", "Clothing", "Books"]),
        name=f"Product {i}", price=round(random.uniform(10, 500), 2))
    for i in range(1, 21)
]
spark.createDataFrame(products).write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable(f"{catalog}.{schema}.products")

# --- Orders ---
orders = []
start_date = datetime.date(2025, 1, 1)
for i in range(1, 51):
    order_date = start_date + datetime.timedelta(days=random.randint(0, 90))
    orders.append(Row(
        order_id=i,
        customer_id=random.randint(1, 10),
        product_id=random.randint(1, 20),
        quantity=random.randint(1, 5),
        order_date=order_date.isoformat(),
        status=random.choice(["Pending", "Shipped", "Delivered", "Cancelled"])
    ))
spark.createDataFrame(orders).write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable(f"{catalog}.{schema}.orders")

print("‚úÖ Genie demo tables created: customers, products, orders")

```

## Step 2 ‚Äî Connect Genie to your tables

- Open the Genie UI.
- Create a new Space and select the three demo tables:
   - `customers`
   - `products`
   - `orders`
- For instructions you can add guidelines for interpretation to help Genie provide accurate answers and relationships (opcional).
  Example:
  - `customers.country` stores the country where each customer resides (string).
  - `products.category` stores the product‚Äôs category (e.g., ‚ÄúElectronics‚Äù, ‚ÄúAccessories‚Äù).
  - when asking for sales totals, compute it as `orders.quantity` * `products.price`.
  - when a user asks for order trends, use `orders.order_date` (string).
  - use `orders.status` to filter between "completed", "pending", or "cancelled" orders.
- Join rules:
  - `orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id` - N:1
  - `orders.product_id = products.product_id`    - N:1

üëâ Now Genie can answer SQL-based questions over these datasets.

### Step 3 - Create the Multi Agent Supervisor

1. Open **Agent Bricks ‚Üí Multi-Agent Supervisor ‚Üí Build**.  
2. Name it, e.g., `Retail-Multi-Agent-Demo`.
3. Add a **Description**: Add some guidelines for Genie. Example: A retail assistant that can answer policy questions from documents, extract structured details from receipts, and query customer and order data
4. In **Configure Agents**: add the following participants (we can add up to 20 agents/tools among {Genie Space/Agent Endpoint/*MCP-coming soon}).
For this exercise we will add only two because at the time of this demo only **Knowledge Agent** and **Genie** are supported as participants for a Multi-Agent:

**Knowledge Assistant** - your RAG bot over UC files/Vector Search  (from section 02)
- **Type**: `Agent Endpoint` | **Agent Endpoint**: Choose the enpoint for our newly created `Knowledge Assistant` 
- The rest of the fields will be populated with the information from the agent


**Genie**
- **Type**: `Genie Space` | **Genie space**: Choose the Genie Space we created `Genie-Retail`
- **Source**: Select the demo tables (`customers`, `products`, `orders`) you created.  
- The rest of the fields will be populated with the information from the agent



5. (Optional) **Instructions** you can add global rules for how the Supervisor should coordinate agents.
   Example:
   - Always provide structured answers.
   - If the query asks about documents, prefer the Knowledge Assistant.
   - When answering from Genie, include top 5 results unless otherwise asked.
   - If the user wants KPIs or aggregations from warehouse tables, consult the Genie Space.
   

7. Click **Create Agent**.

> Multi-Agent Supervisor is designed to **coordinate** Genie Spaces, Agent Bricks endpoints, and tools.

> The supervisor uses AI orchestration patterns to manage **delegation and result synthesis**. Keep guidelines explicit and concise.

---

## Step 4 - Test the Supervisor

Use the **Test your Agent** panel to run prompts that require delegation:
Try composite prompts like:
  Once configured, you can run composite queries such as:

- ‚ÄúWhat is the return policy for electronics? `(Knowledge)` Also, list the top 3 customers by total spend. `(Genie)`‚Äù


![Add-Participants](assets/multi6.png)

Tips:
- If routing looks wrong, refine the **guidelines** with clearer triggers (keywords, examples).
- Keep sample prompts concise and unambiguous.

---

## Use the Supervisor in SQL (ai_query)

Click **Use** to open the SQL/AI editor. Call your supervisor endpoint by name/ID:

```sql
SELECT
  ai_query(
    "retail-multi-agent-demo",   -- your supervisor name or endpoint ID
    "Summarize our receipt totals by customer, and cite sources if any were used"
  ) AS response;
```

---


## Key Takeaway

With Genie, Knowledge Assistant, and Information Extraction combined, the Supervisor Agent can:
- Answer natural language questions from documents.
- Extract structured insights from unstructured text.
- Run SQL analytics over structured data.

This demonstrates the power of multi-agent orchestration in Databricks.
