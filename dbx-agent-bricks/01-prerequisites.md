## Workshop Setup

1. **Clone this repo.**  
2. Run the setup script:  

   ```bash
   python 02_data_prep/assets_generator.py

This will create the demo assets:

- A UC Volume with Markdown files (FAQ.md, Policies.md, Catalog.md) for the Knowledge Assistant.

- JSONL documents (contracts, receipts, notes) for Information Extraction.

ðŸ‘‰ After this step, youâ€™ll have all the assets needed to follow the UI demos for both Knowledge Assistant and Information Extraction.

## Notes

**Permissions:** ensure your Databricks user has:

`USE CATALOG`
`USE SCHEMA`
`CREATE VOLUME`
`CREATE TABLE`

**File limits:** Knowledge Assistant currently skips files larger than 50 MB.

**Governance:** All access is secured by Unity Catalog, so data will only be available to those with the right permissions.
