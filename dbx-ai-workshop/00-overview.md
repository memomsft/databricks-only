# 00 â€“ Overview


This repo helps solution engineers demo an **end-to-end LLM workflow on Databricks**:


- Natural language **agents** with governance
- **Real-time inference** via Model Serving
- **Feature Serving** for consistent, fresh features
- **Guardrails** with AI Gateway


Use the UI-first Agent Bricks demo for the wow factor; then switch to programmatic flows to prove enterprise readiness.
