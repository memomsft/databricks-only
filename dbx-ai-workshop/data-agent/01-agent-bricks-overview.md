# Agent Bricks – Overview


**Agent Bricks** helps you build, evaluate, and optimize AI agents grounded in your enterprise data. In this workshop, you’ll try three packaged patterns:


1) **Knowledge Assistant** – high‑quality Q&A over documents and Lakehouse tables.
2) **Information Extraction (IE)** – convert unstructured text (contracts, notes) into structured tables.
3) **Multi‑Agent Supervisor** – coordinate multiple tools/agents to solve complex tasks.


> Security & governance: Agent Bricks respects Unity Catalog permissions and integrates with evaluation datasets, judges, and optimization out of the box.
