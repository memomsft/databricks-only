# Agent Bricks – UI Walkthrough

## What is Agent Bricks?
Agent Bricks is Databricks’ feature for creating **AI agents that understand your Lakehouse**.  
Agents can answer in natural language, generate secure SQL, and respect Unity Catalog permissions.

## Why use it?
- **Democratization**: business users ask questions in plain English, no SQL required.  
- **Security**: responses are governed by Unity Catalog access controls.  
- **Speed**: empowers analysts to self-serve insights instead of waiting on BI teams.  

### Real-world example
In retail, a sales analyst can ask:  
> “Show me the top 5 customers by total spend this month”  
and get results instantly, without writing a query.

## Demo – Create an Agent

1. Open **Genie / Agent Bricks** in the Databricks sidebar.  
2. Click **Create new Agent / Space** and name it `Sales-Agent-Demo`.  
3. Connect datasets: select the tables `customers`, `products`, and `orders` from your schema.  
4. Add a description, e.g.:  
   > “Fictional retail dataset: customers, orders, and products.”  
5. Test prompts (examples in `sample_queries.md`):  
   - “Top 5 customers by total spend last 7 days”  
   - “Orders by status”  
   - “Revenue by product category”  
6. Show the **SQL translation** generated by the agent and emphasize transparency.  

👉 **Expected outcome**: a working agent that provides natural language answers while generating SQL queries you can audit.
