# 02 – Databricks Prep (Dummy Data & Streaming Simulation)

This section prepares the Databricks environment with **dummy tables** that Genie can query.  
We will create a few base tables and simulate **real-time updates** to mimic a production-like workload.

**Note:** You can skip this section if you prefer working with your existing tables in Databricks or you can leverage the built-in delta share `samples` that contains multiple existing datasets in Databricks

# Ficticious Scenario

💊 **Pharma-Cold Chain Monitoring**

Pharma companies care deeply about cold chain integrity – vaccines, biologics, and temperature-sensitive drugs must stay in 2–8 °C at all times.
This Genie demo can simulate a real-time monitoring system:

**Tables:**

SHIPMENTS (SHIPMENT_ID, PRODUCT, ROUTE, ORIGIN, DESTINATION)

SENSORS (SENSOR_ID, SHIPMENT_ID, POSITION)

READINGS (READING_TS, SENSOR_ID, TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, GPS_LAT, GPS_LON)

**Business Context:**

“We are monitoring real-time telemetry from refrigerated trucks delivering vaccines across Mexico. If temperature exceeds 8 °C for more than 10 minutes, product might be compromised.”

**Genie Example Questions:**

“Muestra los embarques que han tenido temperatura promedio mayor a 8 °C en las últimas 24 h.”

“Grafica la tendencia de temperatura del embarque 12345.”

“¿Qué rutas presentan mayor número de alertas en la última semana?”

## 🛠️ Step 1 – Upload sample files
For this scenario we need 3 datasets :  `shipments`, `sensors`, `readings` that simulate the data that is generated by 


## 🛠️ Step 2 – Create Base Tables

Open a **Databricks Notebook** (Python or PySpark) and run the following code to create 3 sample tables:
